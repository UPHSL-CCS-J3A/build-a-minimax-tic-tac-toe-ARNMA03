Insights:

This code helped me understand how the Minimax algorithm works, 
especially how it allows the AI to make smart decisions in Tic-Tac-Toe. However, 
I still find some parts a bit confusing, and I actually prefer the manual version of 
Minimax that uses the decision tree, since it‚Äôs easier for me to follow and visualize the process.
